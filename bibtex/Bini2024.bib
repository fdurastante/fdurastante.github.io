abstract = {Given a stochastic matrix P partitioned in four blocks Pij, i,j=1,2, Kemeny's constant κ(P) is expressed in terms of Kemeny's constants of the stochastic complements P1=P11+P12(I−P22)−1P21, and P2=P22+P21(I−P11)−1P12. Specific cases concerning periodic Markov chains and Kronecker products of stochastic matrices are investigated. Bounds to Kemeny's constant of perturbed matrices are given. Relying on these theoretical results, a divide-and-conquer algorithm for the efficient computation of Kemeny's constant of graphs is designed. Numerical experiments performed on real world problems show the high efficiency and reliability of this algorithm.}
