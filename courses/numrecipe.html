Environmental Sciences - Universit√† degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia - A.A. 2021/22</h2>

<p>Numerical simulations are computations we run on a computer with programs
implementing a mathematical model for a chemical, physical or biological system.
We need them to study the behavior of processes whose mathematical formulations
are too complex to provide analytical solutions. The computational science area
is itself a rapidly growing field. While the largest and most accurate
simulations often use advanced computing capabilities, there is an ample
layer of small and intermediate problems across many disciplines that we can
face with easier-to-handle tools. This course will address one of such tools
called MATLAB. We will use it to perform small-scale computer simulations.
In the first place, we are going to introduce the programming language on
its own and take some familiarity with it. Then, we will apply it to solve
some problems in Earth, Life, and Chemical sciences.</p>

<p><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Two lessons per week of two hours each from
  the 1st of March. Tuesday and Thursday from 9.00 to 11.00.</p>

<p><strong>Modalities:</strong> The course will take place online in
  synchronous mode on <a href="https://cutt.ly/yPzEEvG" target="_blank">
    Microsoft Teams.</a> </p>

<p><strong>Lecture notes:</strong> lecture notes and exercises are available
<a href="https://cirdans-home.github.io/recipesforenvsciences/" target="_blank">on-line</a>.</p>
