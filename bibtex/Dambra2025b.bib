    abstract  = {In this chapter, we describe the Parallel Sparse Computation Toolkit (PSCToolkit), a suite of libraries for solving large-scale linear algebra problems in an HPC environment. In particular, we focus on the tools provided for the solution of symmetric and positive-definite linear systems using up to 8192 GPUs on the EuroHPC-JU Leonardo supercomputer. PSCToolkit is an ongoing mathematical software project aimed at exploiting the extreme computational speed of current supercomputers for relevant problems in Computational and Data Science. The toolkit is designed for flexibility and usability, supporting integration with both Fortran and C/C++, enabling researchers and developers from diverse computational backgrounds to leverage its powerful capabilities.},
