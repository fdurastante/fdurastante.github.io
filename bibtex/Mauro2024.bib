abstract={The practice of nocturnal navigation in the Mediterranean Sea could be inferred from both archaeological and written records. While there is sufficient proof that the ships and their crew were quite familiar with nighttime sailing, current scholarship has not satisfactorily investigated how the reduction of visibility could have affected the nautical practice. For this reason, the aim of this contribution is twofold: (1) to evaluate to what extent visibility was reduced at night, and (2) to understand what kind of strategies (if any) could be put in place to overcome the difficulties of a low level of visibility. Amongst the strategies, we will also assess the impact on visibility of fixed and portable lighting devices, such as torches and pierced amphoras, as documented by the archaeological and literary evidence.},
